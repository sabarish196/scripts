Goal: Ansible and On-Prem Automations

As the lead of this project, I successfully migrated multiple automation workflows, including server builds and DNS automation, from Ansible Tower to Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) without any user impact. I also refactored and redesigned the DNS automation to improve its efficiency and execution speed.

In addition to these achievements, I delivered several critical automation projects:
	•	Akamai Automation: Automated the creation of new sites in Akamai, streamlining a previously manual process.
	•	Qualys Automation: Developed a solution to retrieve a list of service accounts with shell access, enhancing security operations.
	•	Disaster Recovery (DR) Automation: Implemented automation for DR recovery and failover processes, ensuring faster and more reliable failover during emergencies.

These initiatives have significantly enhanced operational efficiency, reduced manual efforts, and improved overall system reliability.
