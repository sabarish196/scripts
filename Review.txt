Goal: Ansible and On-Prem Automations

As the lead of this project, I successfully migrated multiple automation workflows, including server builds and DNS automation, from Ansible Tower to Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) without any user impact. I also refactored and redesigned the DNS automation to improve its efficiency and execution speed.

In addition to these achievements, I delivered several critical automation projects:
	•	Akamai Automation: Automated the creation of new sites in Akamai, streamlining a previously manual process.
	•	Qualys Automation: Developed a solution to retrieve a list of service accounts with shell access, enhancing security operations.
	•	Disaster Recovery (DR) Automation: Implemented automation for DR recovery and failover processes, ensuring faster and more reliable failover during emergencies.

These initiatives have significantly enhanced operational efficiency, reduced manual efforts, and improved overall system reliability.

Served as the point of contact and one of the engineers for the GCP 3.0 project, focusing on the design and documentation of App Substrate Automation. Led efforts to develop a scalable and modular architectural blueprint, identified key workflows and integration points across GCP services, and collaborated with stakeholders to ensure alignment on requirements. Additionally, authored detailed implementation guides and operational documentation, including troubleshooting procedures and best practices, to support the maintainability and efficiency of the automation processes.
