Goal: Ansible and On-Prem Automations

As the lead of this project, I successfully migrated multiple automation workflows, including server builds and DNS automation, from Ansible Tower to Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) without any user impact. I also refactored and redesigned the DNS automation to improve its efficiency and execution speed.

In addition to these achievements, I delivered several critical automation projects:
	•	Akamai Automation: Automated the creation of new sites in Akamai, streamlining a previously manual process.
	•	Qualys Automation: Developed a solution to retrieve a list of service accounts with shell access, enhancing security operations.
	•	Disaster Recovery (DR) Automation: Implemented automation for DR recovery and failover processes, ensuring faster and more reliable failover during emergencies.

These initiatives have significantly enhanced operational efficiency, reduced manual efforts, and improved overall system reliability.

Served as the point of contact and one of the engineers for the GCP 3.0 project, focusing on the design and documentation of App Substrate Automation. Led efforts to develop a scalable and modular architectural blueprint, identified key workflows and integration points across GCP services, and collaborated with stakeholders to ensure alignment on requirements. Additionally, authored detailed implementation guides and operational documentation, including troubleshooting procedures and best practices, to support the maintainability and efficiency of the automation processes.




Acted as the point of contact from the automation engineering team while also contributing as one of the engineers to the design of App Substrate Automation for the GCP 3.0 project. Played a vital role in crafting a scalable and modular architectural blueprint, defining key workflows and integration points, and working closely with stakeholders to ensure alignment with project requirements. Additionally, developed detailed implementation guides and operational documentation to enhance the efficiency, maintainability, and reliability of the automation processes.




This year, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects and initiatives, contributing to various areas that supported our team’s objectives. Among these, there were a few that stood out as having the most significant impact. These included [insert impactful items, e.g., “streamlining automation processes to improve efficiency,” “leading the integration of new tools to enhance collaboration,” or “driving key deliverables for high-priority projects”]. These efforts not only delivered measurable results but also aligned with our goals of [mention outcomes, e.g., “boosting productivity,” “enhancing customer satisfaction,” or “achieving operational excellence”].

To document the most significant example of how you demonstrated the expected behaviors from this “How Goals” framework, consider these steps:
	1.	Identify a Key Action: Choose a specific action or project where you clearly demonstrated the values of Caring, Curious, or Committed.
	2.	Connect to Behaviors: Align your action with the detailed behaviors mentioned in the framework:
	•	For Caring: Emphasize how you actively listened, built trust, or cared for someone’s emotional or physical well-being.
	•	For Curious: Focus on how you pursued learning, collaborated, or innovated effectively.
	•	For Committed: Highlight how you delivered results, used resources effectively, or took bold actions that aligned with your organization’s mission.
	3.	Provide Impact: Mention the outcomes or positive changes resulting from your actions to illustrate their significance.

Here’s a sample structure for your comment:
	•	Behavior: (e.g., Caring – Empathized and resolved a teammate’s challenge)
	•	Action: Describe what you did in one or two sentences.
	•	Impact: Explain the result or improvement.

Here’s a polished version of your comment for “Caring”:

Caring: I actively supported my Ansible teammates by resolving blockers they encountered during deployments, including issues involving other teams. Additionally, I assisted the Software Engineering (SE) team in addressing intermittent challenges, such as Terraform module issues, scripting help, and other blockers. My efforts not only improved team productivity but also strengthened collaboration and trust, fostering a better bond across the entire team.



We successfully migrated from Ansible Tower to Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), transitioning around 20 workflows and more than 100 job templates for server builds and DNS management. The project, which began in June and was completed by October, required careful planning and execution. Our team of three collaborated closely to prioritize milestones, address challenges, and meet deadlines. One of the significant hurdles was implementing ServiceNow changes, which initially required about 45 days. Through proactive follow-ups and consistent communication, we expedited the process and ensured the migration was completed on time.
