**Demonstrating Humana Values During a Workday Task**

During a recent project involving the implementation of a new module in Workday, I strived to exemplify Humanaâ€™s core values of Caring, Curious, and Committed.

**Caring:**
Throughout the project, I made a concerted effort to show care and support for my colleagues. Recognizing that the transition to the new module could be challenging, I frequently checked in with team members to see if they needed assistance or guidance. When a teammate was struggling to understand a particular feature, I patiently explained the process, offering step-by-step guidance and additional resources to ensure they felt supported and confident.

**Curious:**
My curiosity played a crucial role in the successful implementation of the new Workday module. Eager to understand its functionalities thoroughly, I proactively sought out additional training materials and attended webinars. I experimented with various features to discover the most efficient ways to use the module, sharing my findings with the team to enhance our collective knowledge and effectiveness.

**Committed:**
I remained deeply committed to the project from start to finish. I dedicated extra hours to ensure the task was completed on time and to a high standard. Whenever challenges arose, I approached them with determination and resilience, seeking out solutions and pushing through obstacles. My commitment to the project was evident in my persistent effort to ensure the successful integration of the new module, ultimately contributing to the team's overall success.

By embodying these values, I was able to contribute meaningfully to the project and support my colleagues, demonstrating the essence of Humana's mission and values.
