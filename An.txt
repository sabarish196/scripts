**Epic Title:** On-Prem Server Build and DNS Automation

**Epic Description:**

This epic focuses on automating the on-premises server provisioning process and the associated DNS record creation using Ansible. The goal is to streamline the server build process, ensuring rapid deployment, consistent configurations, and automated DNS updates.

**Objectives:**

1. **Automated Server Provisioning:**
   - Develop and implement Ansible playbooks to automate the provisioning of on-premises servers, ensuring consistent and error-free deployment.
   - Include steps for hardware initialization, operating system installation, and application deployment as part of the automated process.

2. **DNS Record Automation:**
   - Automate the creation and management of DNS records for newly provisioned servers using Ansible, ensuring that all servers are correctly registered and accessible within the network.
   - Implement validation steps to verify DNS entries and ensure alignment with the existing network architecture.

3. **Integration with Infrastructure Tools:**
   - Ensure seamless integration of the Ansible automation with existing on-premises infrastructure management tools, including VMware and DNS management systems.
   - Develop custom Ansible modules or scripts if required to support specific aspects of the on-prem environment and DNS systems.

4. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Provide detailed documentation for all automation scripts and processes, ensuring transparency and ease of use for the IT team.
   - Conduct training sessions to familiarize the team with the new server build and DNS automation workflows.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Faster, more reliable server provisioning processes.
- Automated, error-free DNS record management for all on-prem servers.
- Enhanced operational efficiency and reduced manual intervention in server and DNS management.
